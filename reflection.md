I consulted with Musa and Alex from other sections. I attented the office hours on Feb14. I am having a lot of putting my ideas into java still. It is an issue that I dont have the fluency yet to know institively what to do in java. Some of the differences that I noticed with Java in comparison to Python is that it is more consise but it is less acepting of mistakes. In java it is not necessary to create componets like scanner and random that in python I would have to create myself. A device that I would give to a person taking this class is to think about the different parts of the project and their relationship and find later how to write it in java. I also think that they should do the extra excercises because the change is really jarring
